## 1 | Introduction to Speare

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears...

Welcome to the realm of sophisticated programming. No more are the days of writing simplistic "for" loops, "if-else" statements, and "classes". Speare brings sophistication to the computer science industry, with terms that only Shakespeare himself might take interest in. With _Speare_, your code will be quite the _superiority complex_ stamp on your GitHub account. Try Speare today!

<br />

## 2 | Features

Speare has a number of different features:

- Static typing
- Complex Nesting
- Sophistication
- JS-like numeric types

Make sure to utilize them all to get the best out of Speare.

<br />

## 3 | Example Code

Below, you will find a comprehensive set of examples of code in Speare. Hopefully this will allow you to see just how bland and homespun other languages are, compared to Speare.

### Hello World:

<table>
<tr> <th>JavaScript</th><th>Speare</th><tr>
</tr>

<td>

`console.log("hello, world")`

</td>

<td>

`speaketh("hello, world")`

</td>
</table>

### Functions:

- Declared with 'enter`
- Comma separated parameters
- Parameters must have their type

<table>
<tr> <th>JavaScript</th><th>Speare</th><tr>
</tr>

<td>

```javascript
function foo(bar, baz) {
  let x = 0
  return x
}
```

</td>

<td>

```
enter Numeral foo(Numeral bar, Numeral baz) {
  alloweth Numeral x be 0
  returneth x
}
```

</td>
</table>

### Variable Declaration and Assignment

- Speare allows for only assignment of variables. You may not create variables with no value
- Speare requires that you state the type of the variable you are creating

<table>
<tr> <th>JavaScript</th><th>Speare</th><tr>
</tr>

<td>

```javascript
var a
var b = 0
var c = "hello"
var d = [6, 4, 3]
var e = { 6: 12, 3: 7 }
```

</td>

<td>

```
alloweth Numeral b be 0
alloweth Lexicographical c be "hello"
alloweth Liste of Numeral d be [6, 4, 3]
alloweth Concordance of Numeral and Numeral e be {6 : 12, 3 : 7}
```

</td>
</table>

### Conditionals

<table>
<tr> <th>JavaScript</th><th>Speare</th><tr>
</tr>

<td>

```javascript
let x = 10
if (x == 10) {
  console.log(x)
} else if (x > 10) {
  console.log("greater")
} else {
  console.log("less")
}
```

</td>

<td>

```
alloweth Numeral x be 10
whether (x tis 10) {
  speaketh(x)
}
subsequently (x nobler 10) {
  speaketh("greater")
}
otherwise {
  speaketh("less")
}
```

</td>
</table>

### For, For-in Loops

- For loops in Speare must have two or three statements within them

<table>
<tr> <th>JavaScript</th><th>Speare</th><tr>
</tr>

<td>

```javascript
for (int x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
  for (int y = 0; y < 20; y++) {
    y += 5;
  }
}
```

</td>

<td>

```
in regards to(alloweth x be 0, x lesser 10, x increment) {
  in regards to (alloweth y be 0, y lesser 20, y increment) {
    y incrementby 5
  }
}
```

</td>
</table>

### While, Do-While loops

<table>
<tr> <th>JavaScript</th><th>Speare</th><tr>
</tr>

<td>

```javascript
while (x) {
  console.log("doing!")
}
```

</td>

<td>

```
whilst(x) {
  speaketh("doing!")
}
```

</td>
</table>

### 3.1 | Printing

Printing in Speare is easy if you're a lexicographer:

`speaketh("quite superior, i must say")`

### 3.2 | Numbers and Arithmetic

Arithmetic is quite fancy! Here are some examples:

#### Addition

`x with 6` adds 6 to the variable `x`.

#### Subtraction

`x without 6` subtracts 6 from the variable `x`.

#### Multiplication

`x accumulate 6` gets the product of 6 and `x`.

#### Division

`x sunder 6` gets the quotient of 6 and `x`.

#### Modulus

`x residue 6` gets the remainder of `x` divided by 6.

#### Exponents

`x exponentiate 6` raises `x` to the 6th power.

#### Absolute value

`absolutization(x)` is the absolute value of `x`.

#### Square root

`quadrangle(x)` gets the square root of `x`.

So you don't have to worry about your lackluster English skills in this part of the Speare language.

### 3.3 | Variables & Types

Similar to Java, declaring or initializing a variable requires that you explicitly provide its type:

`alloweth Numeral x be 0`

Speare types include:

- Numeral (integer, float, etc.)
- Lexicographical (strings)
- ToBeOrNotToBe (boolean)
- Indistinguishable (None)
- Ideogram (symbol)
- Enter (function)
- IllUsed (null)
- Accommodation (object)
- Liste (list)
- Concordance (dictionary)

 <br />

#### 3.3.1 | Numeral

The numeral type contains what other languages might consider both "integers" and "floats" (or in some cases, doubles).

`alloweth Numeral x be 6 with 7 without 8 exponentiate 9`

<br />

#### 3.3.2 | Lexicographical

Lexicographicals are strings, easy enough.

`alloweth Lexicographical myopinion be "I am so sophisticated"`

#### 3.3.3 | ToBeOrNotToBe

That is the question, is it not? These are true/false values of `faithful` and `fallacious`.

`alloweth ToBeOrNotToBe flatearththeory be fallacious`

<br />

### 3.4 | Compositions

Compositions... or as the casuals call them, "classes," are very simple to create in Speare, yet so snazzy.

`Composition Foo {...}`

### 3.5 | Reserved Words

Here is a list of all reserved words in the language:

- alloweth
- enter
- ToBeOrNotToBe
- Numeral
- Lexicographical
- IllUsed
- Ideogram
- Corollary
- indistinguishable
- fallacious
- faithful
- null
- with
- without
- accumulate
- sunder
- residue
- exponentiate
- absolutization
- quadrangle
- Composition
- tis nobler
- tis not
- tis lesser
- tis
- nobler
- lesser
- furthermore
- alternatively
- nay
- be
- increment
- incrementby
- decrement
- decrementby
- whether
- subsequently
- otherwise
- trigger
- condition
- exit
- whilst
- execute
- in regards to
- within

<br />

### 3.6 | Semantic Errors

- Variable assignment with incompatible types
- Non-distinct keys for Concordances
- Variable reassignment with incompatible types
- Listes have inconsistent types
- Exit outside of loop
- Attempts to call a non-function or constructor
- Function with no return
- Returning a value where no value should be returned
- Wrong return type
- mismatching parameter types
- Creating a variable with an id that has already been used
- Referencing an unused identifier
- Compositions will raise a semantic error. They are not yet implemented

<br />

### 4.0 | Installation

To run Spear, fork and pull this repo. Run `npm install`, cd to the speare project folder.
You can run several different commands with the Speare compiler:
`node ./src/speare.js <your/directory/code.speare ast` will output the ast for your speare program.
`node ./src/speare.js <your/directory/code.speare analyzed` will output the analyzed speare file.
`node ./src/speare.js <your/directory/code.speare generated` will output the JavaScript code version.
`node ./src/speare.js <your/directory/code.speare optimized` will output the optimized semantically analyzed representation.
`node ./src/speare.js <your/directory/code.speare js` will output the translation to JavaScript
