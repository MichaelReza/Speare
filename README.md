# Speare

## 1 | Introduction to Speare

Welcome to the realm of sophisticated programming. No more are the days of writing simplistic "for" loops, "if-else" statements, and "classes". Speare brings sophistication to the computer science industry, with terms that only Shakespeare himself might take interest in. With _Speare_, your code will be quite the _superiority complex_ stamp on your GitHub account. Try Speare today!

## 2 | Features

Speare has a number of different features:

- Here is one
- Here is another
- As you can see, this is a WIP
- But here is another

Make sure to utilize them all to get the best out of Speare.

<br />

## 3 | Example Code

Below, you will find a comprehensive set of examples of code in Speare, and the identical example written in JavaScript. Hopefully this will allow you to see just how bland and homespun other languages are, compared to Speare.

### 3.1 | Printing & Comments

Printing in Speare is easy if you're a lexicographer:

`Example code`

See? Commenting can be seen in the same light:

`Example Code`

### 3.2 | Numbers and Arithmetic

All the arithmetic is the same in Speare as most other languages:

`Example Code`

So you don't have to worry about your lackluster English skills in this part of the Speare language.

### 3.3 | Variables & Types

###### This section will outline all of the types found in Speare

 <br />

#### 3.3.1 | Number

The number type contains what other languages might consider both "integers" and "floats" (or in some cases, doubles). Here is how they work in Speare:

`Example Code`

<br />

#### 3.3.2 | String

Strings work as expected:

`Example Code`

#### 3.3.3 | Boolean

The Boolean values are a bit different in Speare compared to JavaScript:

`Example Code`

<br />

#### 3.3.4 | Array

The Array type is very special in Speare:

`Example Code`

<br />

#### 3.3.5 | Function

Function declaration is quite the mouthful:

`Example Code`

And you can return like so:

`Example Code`

<br />

#### 3.3.6 | Object

Objects are the root of each type in Speare. Just as everything in the universe is made up of some object:

`Example Code`

<br />

### 3.4 | Loops

###### This section will cover both types of loops in Speare

<br />

#### 3.4.1 | For Loops

Deterministic loops in Speare are verbose:

`deterministically(...)`

  <br />

#### 3.4.2 | While Loops

non-deterministic loops are the same way:

`nondeterministically(...)`

  <br />

### 3.5 | Functions & Return Statements

Defining a function looks like this:

`demarcate foo(...)`

and returning a value:

`reimburse ...`

<br />

### 3.6 | Structures & Classes

Classes (or structures) can be defined as such:

`configuration Foo(...)`

### 3.7 | Reserved Words

Here is a list of all reserved words in the language:

- word
- word
- word
- word
- word
- word
- word
- word

<br />

### 3.8 | Semantic Errors

- error
